<p>Rev. “Billy” Sunday (as he is familiarly known) was
born in a log cabin in the backwoods of Story County,
Iowa, November 19, 1862. Not long after his birth his
father went to the Civil War and never returned. Billy
remained home until he was about fourteen years of age,
and as a hired hand later lived with Colonel John Scott,
former Lieutenant Governor of Iowa, and was enabled
to acquire a high-school education. He tried various lines
of work, from a hired hand at sixteen years old to a furniture
polisher, driver of a hearse, member of a volunteer
hose company, railroad fireman, ball player, student and
now evangelist.</p>

<p>“Twenty-seven years ago I walked down a street in
Chicago in company with some ball players who were
famous in this world—some of them are dead now—and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
we went into a saloon. It was Sunday afternoon and we
got tanked up and then went and sat down on a corner.
I never go by that street without thanking God for saving
me. It was a vacant lot at that time. We sat down on a
curbing. Across the street a company of men and women
were playing on instruments—horns, flutes and slide trombones—and
the others were singing the gospel hymns
that I used to hear my mother sing back in the log cabin
in Iowa and back in the old church where I used to go
to Sunday school.</p>

<p>“And God painted on the canvas of my recollection
and memory a vivid picture of the scenes of other days
and other faces.”</p>

<h3>“WON’T YOU COME?”</h3>

<p>“Many have long since turned to dust. I sobbed and
sobbed and a young man stepped out and said: ‘We are
going down to the Pacific Garden mission. Won’t you
come down to the mission? I am sure you will enjoy it.
You can hear drunkards tell how they have been saved
and girls tell how they have been saved from the red light
district. I arose and said to the boys: “I’m through.
We’ve come to the parting of the ways,” and I turned my
back on them. Some of them laughed and some of them
mocked me; one of them gave me encouragement; others
never said a word. Twenty-seven years ago I turned and
left that little group on the corner of State and Madison
streets, walked to the little mission, fell on my knees and
staggered out of sin and into the arms of the Saviour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>I went over to the west side of Chicago where I was
keeping company with a girl now my wife, Nell. I married
Nell. She was a Presbyterian, so I am a Presbyterian.
Had she been a Catholic, I would have been a
Catholic—because I was hot on the trail of Nell.</p>

<p>The next day I had to go out to the ball park and practice.
Every morning at 10 o’clock we had to be out there
and practice. I never slept that night. I was afraid of the
horse-laugh that the gang would give me because I had
taken my stand for Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>I walked down to the old ball grounds. I will never
forget it. I slipped my key into the wicket gate and the
first man to meet me after I got inside was Mike Kelley.</p>

<p>Up came Mike Kelley. He said: “Bill I’m proud of you—religion
is not my long suit, but I’ll help you all I can.”
Up came Anson, Pfeffer, Clarkson, Flint, McCormick,
Burns, Williamson and Dalrymple. There wasn’t a fellow
in that gang who knocked, every fellow had a word
of encouragement for me.</p>

<p>That afternoon we played the old Detroit club. We
were neck and neck for the championship. That club
had Thompson, Richardson, Rowe, Dunlap, Hanlon and
Bennett, and they could play ball. I was playing right
field and John G. Clarkson was pitching. He was as fine
pitcher as ever crawled into a uniform. There are some
pitchers today, O’Toole, Bender, Wood, Mathewson, Johnson,
Marquard, but I do not believe any one of them
stood in the class with Clarkson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>We had two men out and they had a man on second
and one on third, and Bennett, their old catcher was at
the bat. Charley had three balls and two strikes on him.
Charley couldn’t hit a high ball. I don’t mean a Scotch
high-ball, but he could kill them when they went about
his knee.</p>

<p>I hollered to Clarkson and said: “One more and we got
’em.”</p>

<p>You know every pitcher digs a hole in the ground where
he puts his foot when he is pitching. John stuck his foot
in the hole and he went clear to the ground. Oh, he could
make them dance. He could throw over-handed, and the
ball would go down and up like that. He is the only man
on earth I have seen do that. The ball would go by so
fast that a thermometer would drop two degrees. John
went clear down, and as he went to throw the ball his
right foot slipped, and the ball went low instead of high.</p>

<p>I saw Charley swing hard and heard the bat hit the
ball with a terrific blow. Bennett had smashed the ball
on the nose. I saw the ball rise in the air and knew it
was going clear over my head.</p>

<p>I could judge within ten feet of where the ball would
light. I turned my back to the ball and ran.</p>

<p>The field was crowded with people and I yelled: ‘Stand
back!’ and the crowd opened like the Red Sea opened for
the rod of Moses. I ran on, and as I ran I made a prayer; it
wasn’t theological, either, I tell you. I said: “God, if
you ever helped mortal man, help me to get that ball, and
you haven’t got much time to make up your mind, either.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>I ran and jumped over the bench and stopped. I
thought I was close enough to catch it. I looked back
and saw it going over my head, and I jumped and shoved
my left hand out and the ball hit it and stuck. At the rate
I was going, the momentum carried me on and I fell under
the feet of a team of horses. I jumped up with the
ball in my hand. Up came Tom Johnson. He was afterwards
Mayor of Cleveland. “Here is $10.00 Bill; buy yourself
the best hat in Chicago. That catch won me $1,500.
Tomorrow go and buy yourself the best suit of clothes
you can find in Chicago.”</p>

<p>An old Methodist minister said to me a few years ago:
“Why, William, you didn’t take the $10.00 did you.” I
said: “You bet I did.”</p>

<p>Listen! Mike Kelley was sold to Boston for $10,000.
Mike got half of the purchase price. He came up to me
and showed me a check for $5,000. John L. Sullivan
the champion fighter, went around with a subscription
paper and the boys raised over $12,000 to buy Mike a
house.</p>

<p>They gave Mike a deed to the house and they had
$1,500 left and gave him a certificate of deposit for that.
His salary for playing with Boston was $4,700 a year.
At the end of that season Mike had spent the $5,000
purchase price and the $5,000 he received as salary and
the $1,500 they gave him and had a mortgage on the
house. And when he died in Pennsylvania they went
around with a subscription to get money enough to put<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
him in the ground. Mike sat there on the corner with me
twenty-seven years ago, when I said: “Goodbye, boys,
I’m through.”</p>

<p>A. G. Spalding signed up a team to go around the world.
I was the first man he asked to sign a contract and Captain
Anson was the second.</p>

<p>I was sliding to second base one day. I always slid
head first, and I hit a stone and cut a ligament loose in
my knee.</p>

<p>I got a doctor and had my leg fixed up and he said to
me: “William, if you don’t go on that trip I will give you
a good leg.” I obeyed and I have as good a leg today as
I ever had. They offered to wait for me at Honolulu and
Australia.</p>

<p>Spalding said: “Meet us in England, and play with us
through England, Scotland and Wales.” I didn’t go.</p>

<p>Ed Williamson, our old short-stop, was a fellow weighing
225 pounds, and a more active man you never saw.
He went with them, and while they were on the ship
crossing the English channel a storm arose. The captain
thought the ship would go down. Then he dropped on
his knees and promised God to be true, and God spoke
and the waves were still. They came back to the United
States and Ed. came back to Chicago and started a saloon
on Dearborn Street.</p>

<p>I would go there and give tickets for the Y. M. C. A.
meetings and would talk with him, and would cry like a
baby, I would get down and pray for him. When he died<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
they put him on the table and cut him open and took out
his liver. It was so big it would not go in a candy bucket.</p>

<p>Ed Williamson sat there on the street corner with me
twenty-seven years ago when I said, “Goodbye, boys, I’m
through.”</p>

<p>Frank Flint, our old catcher, who caught for nineteen
years, drew $3,200 a year on an average. He caught
before they had chest protectors and masks and gloves.
He caught bare-handed. Every bone in the ball of his
hand was broken. You never saw a hand like Frank
had. Every bone in his face was broken and his nose and
cheekbones, and the shoulder and ribs had all been
broken.</p>

<p>I’ve seen old Frank Flint sleeping on a table in a stale
beer joint and I’ve turned my pockets inside out and said:
“You’re welcome to it, old pal.”</p>

<p>He drank on and on, and one day in winter he staggered
out of a stale beer joint and stood on a corner and was
seized with a fit of coughing.</p>

<p>The blood streamed out of his nose, his mouth and his
eyes. Down the street came a woman. She took one
look and said: “My God, is it you, Frank?” And the old
love came back.</p>

<p>The wife called two policemen and a cab and started
with him to her boarding house. They broke all speed
regulations. She called five of the best physicians, and
they listened to the beating of his heart—eight, nine, ten,
eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen—and the doctor said:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
“He will be dead in about four hours.” She said: “Frank
the end is near,” and he said: “Send for Bill.”</p>

<p>They telephoned me and I came. When I reached his
bedside he said to me: “There’s nothing in the life of
years ago I care for now. I can hear the grandstand
hiss when I strike out. I can hear the bleachers cheer
when I make a hit that wins the game, but there is nothing
that can help me now, and if the umpire calls me
out now, won’t you say a few words over me, Bill?”</p>

<p>He struggled as he had years ago on the diamond when
he tried to reach home—but the great Umpire of the universe
yelled: “You’re out.” And the great gladiator of
the diamond was no more.</p>

<p>Frank Flint sat on the street corner drunk with me
twenty-seven years ago in Chicago when I said: “I’ll
bid you goodbye, boys, I’m going to Jesus.” Say men, did
I win the game of life, or did they?</p>

school, no little kiss to linger on their lips, and when they
come home at noon, hungry, there is no kind greeting.
The old man never says a word unless he growls for you

They are flattered and cajoled, and they look upon
themselves as sort of an especial form upon which to
hang the latest creation of a Worth or a Redfern. They
have digestive apparatus with which to digest highly seasoned
foods which some rich husband can buy and cram
into their gullets. And they lend their presence to vaudeville,
and have vaudeville performances in their homes,

which border on the obscene. And they indulge in gambling

roamed through the field, forest, city and hamlet, and as

The angel said: ‘Now that my visit is over, before I return
I must gather some mementoes of my trip.’ He looked at
the beautiful flowers in the garden and said, ‘How lovely
and fragrant,’ and plucked the rarest roses, made a bouquet,
and said, ‘I see nothing more beautiful and fragrant
than these flowers.’ The angel looked further and saw
a bright-eyed, rosy-cheeked child, and said, ‘That baby
is prettier than the flowers; I will take that, too;’ and,
looking beyond to the cradle, he saw a mother’s love pouring
out over her babe like a gushing spring, and the angel
said, ‘The mother’s love is the prettiest thing I have seen;
I will take that too.’ And with these three treasures the
heavenly messenger winged his flight to the pearly gates,
saying: ‘Before I go in I must examine the mementoes of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
my trip to the earth.’ He looked at the flowers; they had
withered. He looked at the baby’s smile; it had faded.
He looked at the mother’s love; it shone in all its pristine
beauty. Then he threw away the withered flowers, cast
aside the faded smile, and with the mother’s love pressed
to his breast, swept through the gates into the city, shouting
that the only thing he had found that would retain its
fragrance from earth to heaven is a mother’s love.”</p>

send them to dancing school and haunts of sin. You have
no right to do those things that will curse your children.
That babe is put in your arms to train for the Lord. No
mother has any more right to raise her children for pleasure
than I have to pick your pockets or throw red pepper
in your eyes. She has no more right to do that than a
bank cashier has to rifle the vaults and take the savings

<p>“There is power in a mother’s song, too. It’s the best
music the world ever heard. There is no brass band or
pipe organ that can hold a candle to mother’s song, the
kind she sings gets tangled up in your heart strings. There
would be a disappointment in the music of heaven to me
if there were no mothers there to sing. The song of an
angel or a seraph would not have much charm for me.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
What would you care for an angel’s song if there is no
mother’s song? The song of a mother is sweeter than that
ever sung by minstrel or written by poet. Talk about
sonnets! You ought to hear the mother sing when her babe
is on her breast, when her heart is filled with emotion.
Her voice may not please an artist, but it will please any
one who has a heart in him. The songs that have moved
the world are not the songs written by the great masters.
I think when we reach heaven it will be found that some
of the best songs we will sing there will be those we
learned at mother’s knee.”</p>

<p>“There is power in a mother’s love. A mother’s love
must be like God’s love. How God could ever tell the
world that He loved it without a mother’s help has often
puzzled me. If the devils in hell ever turned pale, it was
the day when mother’s love flamed up for the first time in
a woman’s heart. If the devil ever got ‘cold feet,’ it was
that day, in my judgment.”</p>

<p>“To teach a child to love the truth and hate a lie, to love
purity and hate vice, is greater than inventing a flying
machine that will take you to the moon, or to the North
pole. Unconsciously, you set in motion influences that
will damn or bless the old universe and bring new worlds
out of chaos and transform them for God.”</p>

is much concerned about it. The first mile that world
takes settles its course for eternity. When God throws a
child out into the world he is mighty anxious that it gets
a right start. The Catholics are right when they say: ‘Give
us the children until they are ten years old, and we don’t
care who has them after that.’ The Catholics are not
losing any sleep about losing men and women from their
church membership. It is the only church that has ever
shown us the only sensible way to reach the masses—that
is, by getting hold of the children. That’s the only way

mock modesty. You can’t trifle with God’s rules. Society
has just about put maternity out of fashion. When
you stop to consider the average society woman I do not
think maternity has lost anything. The child of affluence
is turned over to nurses at birth and is fed on prepared
foods and knows nothing of its mother. The children of
humbler homes are raised by their mothers, instead of
being turned over to governesses. These mothers spend

Maternity is the highest possible gift of God to

their criminal knowledge. Some girls marry for society,
some marry for home, some marry for ease, some marry
to reform man; he wouldn’t marry you to reform you—you

<p>“Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand
of his lords and drank wine before the thousands.</p>

<p>“Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to
bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar
had taken out of the temple which was in
Jerusalem; that the king and his princes, his wives and
his concubines might drink therein.</p>

<p>“They drank wine and praised the gods of gold, and of
silver, of brass, of iron, of wood and of stone.</p>

<p>“In the same hour came forth fingers of a man’s hand
and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster
of the wall of the king’s palace; and the king saw part of
the hand that wrote.</p>

<p>“Then the king’s countenance was changed and his
thoughts troubled him so that the joints of his loins were
loosed and his knees smote one against another.</p>

<p>“The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the
Chaldeans and the soothsayers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>“Then came the king’s wise men; but they could not
read the writing nor make known to the king the interpretation
thereof.</p>

<p>“Then was Daniel brought before the king, and the king
said: “If thou canst read the writing thou shalt be clothed
with scarlet and have a chain of gold about thy neck and
shalt be third ruler of the kingdom.”</p>

<p>“Then Daniel answered and said before the king, “Let
thy gifts be to thyself and give thy rewards to another;
yet I will read the writing and make known unto the king
the interpretation.”</p>

<p>“And this is the writing that was written: MENE, MENE,

<p>Belshazzar’s feast was no common beer, pretzel and
dill pickle blow-out, but the real goods. Nude and lewd
women wormed and wriggled their way through the banquet
hall. The bunch began to get soused and the revelry
increased.</p>

<p>Then came the obscene song, the drunken hiccough, the
slavering lip, and the guffaw of idiotic laugh bursting
from the lips of princes, flushed, reeling and bloodshot,
while mingled with it all were the hurrahs for great Belshazzar.</p>

<p>Then from the atmosphere flashed an armless hand
which wrote upon the frieze in words that blazed like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
fire and glistened like gold. Terror froze Belshazzar to
the very soul. His countenance changed, his thoughts
troubled him so that the joints of his loins were loose
and his knees smote together. I tell you old “Bel” was
about all in.</p>

<p>In a few moments he hoarsely cried: “Bring in the astrologers,
the Chaldeans and the soothsayers (we’d call
’em mediums today). And in came the Magi and when
they couldn’t decipher the heiroglyphics, Belshazzar
cried, “Give ’em the hook.”</p>

<p>Then he sent for Daniel on his mother’s advice.</p>

<p>I can see him say: “Put her there Dan,” as he slapped
his hand in Daniel’s, and say, “My maw’s be tellin’ me
about you. This bunch has got on my nerves. The four-flushers
have been feedin’ and fattenin’ around here and
can’t read that writing. If you’ll do it I’ll give you a chain
and a ring of gold.”</p>

<p>But Daniel said: “Nothin’ doing on the chain and ring
proposition, Bel.” Then Daniel read the writing. “MENE,
MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.”</p>

them for deepening the spirit here tonight. Bless all
newspaper boys who are giving us such wonderful reports.

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HITTING_THE_SAWDUST_TRAIL">“HITTING THE SAWDUST TRAIL.”</h2>

</div>

<p>The meaning “to hit the sawdust trail,” has a beautiful
and appropriate meaning. It was first used when Sunday
and his party were in the midst of a campaign among
the lumbermen on Puget Sound. At the tabernacle at
Bellingham, Washington. The floor of the tabernacle was
covered with the sawdust from the lumber camp and the
lumbermen, when any of their men went down front to
speak to Rev. Sunday, called it “Hitting the Trail.”</p>

<p>In the lumber camps in the mountains there is a trail
that leads through the fastness of the wooded mountain
side covered by wood chips, so as to make it conspicuous
by night as well as by day. The woodsmen some time
wander far away from camp and are lost in the primeval
forest. In their wanderings, if they can “hit the trail,”
they are saved, as it leads to the safety and shelter of the
camp. So on the pathway of life if you can, “hit the
trail,” of God’s mercy through the Lord Jesus Christ you
are led to safety. So these rude lumbermen called the
giving up of self to God and going down the sawdust
isle of the tabernacle—“Hitting the Trail.”</p>

<p>The phrase stuck to the Sunday party ever since and
it has a thrilling touch of the wildwood and a meaning
that is very appropriate and beautiful when taken in the
language of the backwoods.</p>

</div>

<p>Billy Sunday paid the following tribute to the Christian
character of General Robert E. Lee, commander of the
Confederate forces in the Civil War:</p>

<p>“There is no man I so delight to honor as the man who
is true. There is no woman I so delight to honor as the
woman who is true. There is no one I so abhor as a man
or woman whose words are untruth and whose promises
are as vapor. I may differ from a man in politics or religion,
and if he is living up to his highest ideals, even if
I think those ideals wrong, I respect him and I will do
my best to clear up his errors and lead him to the sunlit
hills of God’s pardon.</p>

<p>“At the beginning of the Civil War General Robert E.
Lee said to General Scott that he was a Union man at
heart, but that his native state of Virginia had seceded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
and that as a loyal son he felt he must cast his fortunes
with the Confederacy. As the war proceeded, Lee saw the
bright hopes of the Confederacy fade, saw its government
overturned and broken at his feet. When the end
came he was a prematurely old man, his health fled, his
fortune gone, his property at Arlington confiscated. At
that time of despair there came to him the officers of the
Louisiana Lottery company, offering to make him its
president.</p>

<p>“‘But, gentlemen,’ he said, ‘I don’t know anything about
the lottery business.’</p>

<p>“‘That makes no difference,’ they said, ‘we do. We
want the use of your name, and we will give you $10,000
a year.’</p>

<p>“General Lee buttoned his coat over his sunken breast,
brushed back his gray hair from his forehead, and said:
‘Gentlemen, my good name and my self respect are all
that is saved from the wreck, and they are not for sale.
You cannot buy Robert E. Lee.’</p>

<p>“My father was a Union soldier. I am a loyal American,
but I say that Robert E. Lee was one of the noblest
Christian characters this country has ever produced, and
that Stonewall Jackson was another.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sunday took Van Dyke’s sketch, “The Lost Word,”
as a theme for his talk. He related how Hermas, the
pagan, after accepting Christianity for several years,
grew tired of it and sold the Word of Jesus for gold, pleasure

women that, if they had ever known Jesus, they could
read their heart’s biography.</p>

<p>“Without that word you are nonentities!” said Sunday,
“Without that word you are lost. And you can’t find it
in society. Do as society wants you to do, and you will
not be doing as Jesus wants you to do. If ease, comfort,
luxury and the chasing of the phantoms of pleasure have

being an old maid, and one of them is marrying the wrong
man. Love is the divinest gift of God to man and woman.
Some of the noblest women in the world have been old
maids; they are not old maids, simply ladies-in-waiting,
but I tell you girls I would rather be an old maid, with
dogs, cats, furniture and bric-a-brac than to be yoked to

<p>Billy Sunday’s impersonation of the leper Naaman,
entering the waters of the Jordan river to dip seven times,
given Thursday night in his sermon on “The Moral
Leper,” in the language of the vaudeville press agent,
was a “bell-ringer.”</p>

<p>Billy, in the role of Naaman, made things so realistic
that his vast audience could almost expand their imagination
enough to see the muddy waters of the river, the
slippery bank and the frightened and shivering Naaman,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
endeavoring to bolster up enough courage to plunge in
and take his seven dips to be cured of leprosy.</p>

<p>Billy cautiously approached the water’s edge, stuck one
toe in to ascertain the temperature of the water, drew it
back with a shiver and an “U-u-gh, but that’s cold!” Then
he stopped to explain that Naaman was not accustomed
to such surroundings, but was used to a porcelain bath
tub at home and to a “crooked-handle dingaramus” to
rub his back with. With this Billy went through the contortions
of a man trying to reach the hollow of his back
with a brush or sponge.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SAYS_WATER_MADE_NAAMAN_SHIVER">SAYS WATER MADE NAAMAN SHIVER.</h2>

<p>He told of a big “snake doctor” stinging Naaman on the
shoulder, emitting an unearthly screech and slapping one
hand to the offended spot. Then he tried the water again.
He got part way in, slipped, stubbed his toe and went hobbling
about on his left foot, holding the other in both
hands as his facial contortions told of Naaman’s pain
after getting hurt. He shivered again, let his teeth chatter
with a loud “b-r-r-r,” as he again went into the water,
pinched his nose shut after taking a long breath, squinted
his eyes and “ducked” under the surface, coming up spluttering,
spitting and choking.</p>

<p>Then Billy told of the spots of leprosy on Naaman beginning
to itch. He nearly had every one in the tabernacle
scratching arms and legs as he vigorously rubbed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
various spots on his body, and scratched ’em. Then he
resumed his ducking stunt. After the seventh dip, he told
of Naaman’s flesh being covered with the delicate skin
of a babe and of him emerging from the river no longer
a leper. Here Sunday ended his monologue with the exclamation,
“Gee, wonder what Mrs. Naaman and the kids
will say when I come home and they see me cured.”</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>An Example of the Evangelist’s Power in Painting Word Pictures.</i></span></h2>

</div>

<p>Twenty-seven years ago with the Holy Spirit as my
guide, I entered at the portico of Geneses and went into
the art gallery of the Old Testament, where, on the wall,
hung pictures of Enoch, Noah, Jacob, Abraham, Elijah,
David, Daniel and other famous prophets of old. Then
I passed into the music room of the Psalms, where the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
spirit swept the keyboard of my nature and brought forth
the dirge—like a wail of the weeping prophet, Jeremiah,
to the grand exultant strain of the 24th Psalm and where
every reed and pipe in God’s great organ of nature seemed
to respond to the tuneful harp of David, as he played for
King Saul in his melancholy moods.</p>

<p>Next I passed into the business office of Proverbs, then
into the chapel of Ecclesiastes, where the voice
of the preacher was heard; then over into the conservatory
of the songs of Solomon, where the Lily of the Valley
and the Rose of Sharon and sweet-scented spices perfumed
my life. Then I stepped into the prophetic room
and saw through telescopes various stars, some pointing
to far-off stars and others to nearby stars, but all concentrated
upon the bright and Morning Star which was to
rise above the moon-lit hills of Judea, while shepherds
guarded their flock by night.</p>

<p>From there I passed into the audience room and
caught a vision of the King from the standpoint of Matthew,
Mark, Luke and John. I then went into the Acts of
the Apostles, where the Holy Spirit was doing office work in
the formation of the Infant Church. From here I went to
the correspondence room where Matthew, Mark, Luke,
John, Paul, Peter, James and Judah sat at their desks,
penning their epistles to the church. Then I passed last
of all into the throne room of Revelations and the king
sitting high upon his throne.</p>

<p>If the Bible were the dreams of men, it would have
gone down long ago. But it still stands like a light-house,
shining out into the darkness, surrounded by thousands
of dead birds, which have battered their brains out,
knocking it.</p>

<p>The biggest fool today is the man who sneers at the
word of God.</p>

<p>God’s word can’t be overthrown. It is too hard for the
tooth of time and will last forever.</p>

<p>God’s plan in the beginning was that man should never
die and that no man should ever work. Now, because
of sin, white or black, Christian or skeptic, civilized or
savage, it’s work for you or over the hills to the poor
house.</p>

<p>You can say, if you want to, that your great-great-great-great-grandfather

uncork our enthusiasm and shoot firecrackers and eat
peanuts and drink red lemonade, for it makes us realize
that we are living in the greatest nation that man’s eye
ever saw or God’s hand ever made. I’m glad we have
Labor day, when the man who toils can have a holiday of
his own. I’m glad we celebrate Easter to commemorate
the time when the Son of Man arose in conquering majesty.
I’m glad we celebrate Thanksgiving, when we sit
at our sumptuously laden tables and recall that as a nation
we have never gone to bed hungry and that our granaries
have never been empty, and reflect that we have one
state that can raise corn enough to feed us all. America
can feed the world. I pay tribute to the man with the dinner
bucket, with bundles of muscle that knot like steel.

With One?—Not On Your Life.”</p>

<p>Sunday pointed out five things which he stated he considered
necessary qualifications to win in life: Blood, environment,
grit, education and religion. He then added
that the first four without the fifth meant nothing at all,
and pleaded with his youthful audience to trust in God.</p>

<p>“It takes more than a mortarboard cap, pipe, peg-top

<p>“Well, Lord, we pray Thou will help us. I’m glad,
Jesus, that I can stand here today and say that after all
these years of trusting in Thee, Thou hast helped me.
Help them, God. We beseech Thee to help us here today.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
Help us as we go along from day to day. There’ll be
troubles, the way will be dark and dreary sometimes.
The sun will not always shine, there’ll be rain and dark
clouds, but they’ll soon clear away. It is the work of the
devil to make it hard for us. It is the devil’s work to make
us weak physically, so that it will be hard to bear the
strain of God’s work. Oh, devil, why do you strike us
when we’re down? Why do you prey upon our weaknesses?
Why do you do it? You know, devil, you and I
are enemies. We always have been.</p>

<p>“There’s no compromise between us. You know, devil,
I’ve never uttered a word, preached a sermon or written
a line that I didn’t believe was right and that I’ll not
stand upon. I wouldn’t take back a single thing I ever
said. And say, devil, if there’s anything in my sermons
that doesn’t hurt you, tell me, and I’ll take it out, and
Lord, if there’s anything in my sermons that doesn’t help
your work, tell me, and I’ll take it out. I’ve learned to
love these people Lord. Oh, their friendship and generosity
have been wonderful. I never saw such love and
kindness, Jesus. I’ve been overwhelmed by it. And now,
today, there may still be some who have not yet taken
their stand, and who’ll be the first to come down and take
me by the hand.”</p>

<p>If I ever accepted the pastorate of a church I’d buy a
round trip ticket.</p>

<p>But believe me, I’d skin the bunch while I was on the
job.</p>

<p>Too many people desert the prayer meeting for a card
party or a Dutch lunch.</p>

<p>Paul was an evangelist. Wherever he preached they
had to call out the cops to protect him. He always had
a riot or a revival.</p>

<p>We need a revival because the churches are critical,
cold, blown in the bottle, stamped on the cork—petrified.
You can’t scald a hog in ice-water.</p>

<p>The world would sink into hell before the Fourth of
July if it had to depend on “ethical” revivals.</p>

<p>If you want to see this city as God wants it to be you’ll
help. If you want it to be as hell and the devil wants it,
then knock.</p>

<p>There are two gangs in every church—the rubs and the
anti-rubs.</p>

<p>Some people have sat in their pews so long that they
are mildewed.</p>

<p>There are multitudes in heaven that have crept and
crawled out of the quagmire of filth and the cesspools of
iniquity and drunkenness.</p>

<p>It takes the combined efforts of the Trinity to keep you
out of hell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>I’ll do anything on earth to help a sinner. I’ll do anything
in the world to put the devil and all his cohorts in
hell.</p>

<p>Conversion must be effected by the influence of the
truth on the mind.</p>

<p>Truth resisted, loses its power on the mind that resists
and each resistance weakens the truth.</p>

<p>When God begins to show His power, then the devil
and all of the demons get busy.</p>

<p>Religion makes its appeal to your sensibility, not your
intellect.</p>

<p>The way into the kingdom is heart first, not head first.</p>

<p>God is not an explanation; God is a revelation.</p>

<p>Most people are converted at revival services.</p>

<p>If you are thirty and have not been converted, the
chances are that if you are not converted now, you will
never be converted.</p>

<p>If it weren’t for revivals, just think what hell would be
like.</p>

<p>If you spurn Jesus Christ you are doing the same thing
which the Pharisees did.</p>

<p>Some say a revival is only temporary; so is a bath, but
it does you good.</p>

<p>Trouble with some fellows is that they have their religion
and property in their wives’ names. You’ve got
to be something more than a brother-in-law to God.</p>

<p>If God had his way there’d be no saloons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>The history of the church is a history of revivals; when
any preacher talks against revivals, he’s a damn scoundrel.</p>

<p>What the Church of God needs today is a baptism of
horse sense.</p>

<p>Some people never read the Bible from week-end to
week-end. No wonder they are dried up like an Egyptian
mummy.</p>

<p>Religion doesn’t affect some poor old sinners any more
than shooting peas at the Rock of Gibraltar with a pop
gun.</p>

<p>If I can win a man over to Christianity—to keep a
drunkard sober, even just for a year, it’s worth every
dollar.</p>

<p>Some of the worst knockers I have in this county are
the preachers—sour grapes; that’s the only way I can see
it.</p>

<p>You’ve been so dignified, stiff and worldly until you’ve
grieved the Spirit of God.</p>

<p>Give the Lord a main line and see what he’ll do these
days.</p>

<p>Never saw God bless a stingy gang yet.</p>

<p>I feel like a shouting Methodist. When you get a Presbyterian
shouting there’s something doing.</p>

<p>I am pleading for the old-fashioned Pentacostal revival.
My evangelism is 2,000 years old; as old as the nails in
the cross.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>If a city sags morally, the reason is not with God, but
with her citizenship. They’d rather have a dirty, rotten
town.</p>

<p>The biggest coward in America today, the biggest coward
we have in the profession of Christian religion, who
is afraid to come out and declare himself in a campaign
like this is the business man. He is afraid of some saloon
keeper, some brewer, some gambler and others of that
kind—they’re afraid they will lose their trade by it, and
by the eternal God they ought to be punished before the
moon changes.</p>

<p>I believe you are getting ready to place this town on
the map as a place where the name of God and decency
are revered.</p>

<p>Over your head, the devil and the angels of God are
locked in a struggle for your soul.</p>

<p>When you work for Jesus you must expect to be abused.</p>

<p>Heaven wants to save you, earth to cheat you and hell
to damn you.</p>

<p>You are just as good as you want to be and not a whit
better.</p>

<p>You haven’t got money enough in your bank vault to
hire me to come here if I didn’t care for the welfare of
your souls.</p>

<p>If man wrote the Bible we’d never been told that Noah
got drunk. Man would have left such things out, but God
didn’t. He put everything in whether pleasant or unpleasant.</p>

<p>When you swell up like a poisoned pup and think you
are complimenting God by being present here tonight,
then God’s got nothing for you.</p>

<p>Some of the biggest heathens this side of hell are right
here tonight.</p>

<p>“No trade” is the passport by which 90 per cent of the
men are entering the prisons and penitentiaries.</p>

<p>You may be lower down in the sight of God than the
one whom you condemn.</p>

<p>The devil believes in God and in hell. He’s more orthodox
than some preachers I know who preach that
there is no hell.</p>

<p>How can you pray when you look at the throne of God
through the bottom of a beer glass.</p>

<p>Some people pray as though they never expected anything
and they’re not disappointed.</p>

<p>How can you pray and say “Thy will be done,” when
you have the booze wagon drive up to your back gate
twice every week.</p>

funerals his way.</p>

on an economic basis.</p>

<p>A free nation cannot endure if it is dominated by grafters,
special interests, thieves and crooks.</p>

<p>The constitution was cradled in prayer.</p>

<p>You spend a whole lot of money for flowers at the funeral
of your wife that you might have spent for a hired
girl.</p>

<p>It’s a good thing for you I’m not God for about fifteen
minutes. I’d keep the undertaker busy unless you squared
up.</p>

<p>I could no more shock some of you folks than I could
pour something on a skunk to make it smell sweet.</p>

<p>It makes no difference whether you kneel before God
as a millionaire or a hobo—it’s a case of sin and salvation.</p>

<p>I don’t care whether you hot-footed it to the Tabernacle
tonight or rode in an auto.</p>

<p>God puts no premium on laziness. You can bank on
that—Jesus Christ is the center, circumference and nucleus
of the Old and New Testament.</p>

<p>I believe that no man disbelieves in hell unless he finds
himself on the straight road to hell.</p>

<p>I wonder God is doing as well as He is with the bunch
He has to work with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></p>

worse and worse.</p>

<p>Blood tells: the time to start training the boy right is

<p>The reason there are so many nickel theatres and hell-holes

enough to retain the boy and girl.</p>

“Children should be seen and not heard.”</p>

<p>The biggest mistake we ever made was to take from the
teachers the right to lick the kids.</p>

<p>I believe the downfall of most men and women can be
traced to some defect in the home.</p>

<p>A home must be something more than four walls and a
roof.</p>

<p>The biggest monstrosity God ever looked at is the
mother with her children playing about her feet and they
not getting an inspiration of Jesus.</p>

<p>If some of you women had to get to heaven on the testimony
of your washerwomen, would you make it?</p>

<p>If you see a kid with its stockings hanging down like the
skin on a rhinoceros, and a dirty nose, it don’t take a
prophet to say, “Ma’s gone to the club.”</p>

<p>Outlawism is not settled by the street mob—it is settled
in the home.</p>

<p>I haven’t much faith in the woman who talks heaven
and makes her home a hell.</p>

<p>Don’t tell the children what you don’t mean.</p>

<p>Don’t talk about your neighbors or anybody else.</p>

<p>Don’t hurt your children’s self-respect by punishing
them in the presence of company. Wait until the company
is gone, then dust both hemispheres.</p>

<p>Don’t lie to your children, and then wonder where they
learned to lie.</p>

<p>Don’t be a fool, and if you’ve got plenty of income,
overdress your children and send them to school to make
the children of some poor, conscientious man dissatisfied
because their dad can’t give them as nice clothes.</p>

<p>The young man or woman who is ashamed of his or
her father or mother, is a fool and too low down for me
to spit on.</p>

<p>The woman who tries to rid herself of the responsibilities
of maternity, is as red-handed and black-hearted a
murderess as she who chokes to death her 12-months old
babe.</p>

<p>Of all the contemptable, triple-extract of hell, God-forsaken,
hell-born, infamous, vile, stinking and damnable
people, the murderer who disguises under the title of
doctor is the worst.</p>

<p>A gambler, if he wins, is a thief, and if he loses, he’s a
fool. So he’s both a thief and a fool, no matter how you
look at it.</p>

<p>If a church runs a lottery, then it’s a thief.</p>

<p>There are three ways of spreading news, telephone, telegraph
and tell-a-woman. But that’s really an insult,
for some of these old he-gossipers have got the women
backed off the boards.</p>

<p>I pity the woman who’ll slap Jesus in the face to please
some miserable society gang.</p>

<p>The dance hall has proved to be the biggest graveyard
this side of hell for young girls.</p>

<p>The fellow who lives purely for the gratification of his
lust, is so low down he’d have to take an airship to reach
hell.</p>

<p>The most useless woman on God’s dirt is the society
woman.</p>

<p>It’s a good thing to have money and all it will buy, but

<p>“The Bible says: ‘In the beginning G-O-D, God!’ I don’t
know when that beginning was, but in the beginning God!
whether it was 6,000 years ago or a hundred of millions
of years ago, as some cranks now claim, created the
heaven and the earth. I don’t believe the doctrine of evolution.
Did this tabernacle evolute? No: common sense
will tell you that. Did flowers evolute? If things have
evoluted, why haven’t they been improved upon during all
these years? Flowers found today along the Nile grew
there in exactly the same form centuries ago. Have they
evoluted? You can put a gold belt around a hog, tie his
sides up with ribbons and he’ll still squeal for slop. He’s
the same old hog. Has he evoluted? If you believe
human beings evoluted from the ape, all right. If you
believe that your great-great-great-great-grandfather was
a monkey with a prehensile tail around the limb of a
cocoanut tree, all right; but don’t connect your monkey
ancestors with me. Listen here, I’m going to stick by that
book—the Bible if I die the very next instant.”

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
